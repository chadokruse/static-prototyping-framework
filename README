Template for starting static sites including Sass, Bourbon and Flutie

* Includes some HTML5 Boilerplate goodness in the index.html file, plus Modernizr.js library - http://html5boilerplate.com/ 
Items were added from version 2.0, which was originally authored on August 10th, 2011.
I took these items from the site on December 18, 2011.

* Sass
If you don't know what Sass is yet, you're welcome: http://sass-lang.com/

* Bourbon
thoughbot's set of Sass mixins: https://github.com/thoughtbot/bourbon

* Flutie
Default styles: https://github.com/thoughtbot/flutie

* Watch Sass stylesheet and require Bourbon. This will also pull Flutie styles into your main stylesheet:
sass --watch stylesheets/sass:stylesheets -r ./stylesheets/sass/bourbon/lib/bourbon.rb

* Jekyll
This should be useable with Jekyll pretty much out of the box, just follow steps to install the gem found at the Jekyll GitHub repo linked here: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll.

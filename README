Template for starting static sites including Sass, Bourbon and Flutie

* Includes some HTML5 Boilerplate goodness in the index.html file, plus Modernizr.js library - http://html5boilerplate.com/ 
	Items were added from version 2.0, which was originally authored on August 10th, 2011.
	I took these items from the site on December 18, 2011.

* Watch Sass stylesheet and require Bourbon:
	sass --watch stylesheets/sass:stylesheets -r ./stylesheets/sass/bourbon/lib/bourbon.rb

* Flutie
	This is already included in application.scss and should be pulled in as long as you remember to start watching Sass as listed above when you are working.

* Jekyll
	This should be useable with Jekyll pretty much out of the box, just follow steps to install the gem found at the Jekyll GitHub repo linked here: https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll.
